To run project:

## Jetson Orin Nano Optimization

The inference module now supports TensorRT. Enable this by setting
`"USE_TENSORRT": true` in `python_ai/config/default.json` and specify the
`TRT_MODEL_PATH` where the optimized model will be stored. On the first run the
model will be converted using TF‚ÄëTRT; subsequent runs load the optimized
version directly. If conversion is not possible the code automatically falls
back to TensorFlow execution.

### Performance Evaluation

When running `python_ai/inference/inference.py`, the processing time of each
cycle is written to `REALTIME.LOG_PATH/processing_time.log` (as configured in
`python_ai/config/default.json`). Compare these timings before and after
enabling TensorRT on Jetson to quantify the speed‚Äëup for your report.

### GPU Gammatone Pre-processing

Set `"USE_TF_GTGRAM": true` in the same configuration to offload the
gammatone spectrogram calculation to TensorFlow running on GPU. This replaces
the slower Python implementation, further improving throughput on Jetson.
